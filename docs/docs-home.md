Below is a guide for installing and configuring AUP to a Minecraft Java server. For additional plugin documentation, see [commands.](./commands)

:::warning
AUP is developed for 1.20.x Minecraft Java servers. Using AUP with other versions of Minecraft may result in stability issues.
:::

Setting up AUP on your server can be accomplished in three steps:

1. [Obtain JAR file](#obtain-jar-file)
2. [Install JAR file](#install-jar-file)
3. [Start and configure](#start-and-configure)

## Obtain JAR file

You can find the latest version of the AUP JAR file [here.](https://github.com/Among-Us-Plugin/source/releases) Alternatively, you can compile the JAR file from source.

## Install JAR file

Place the AUP JAR file in the `/plugins` directory of your Minecraft Server.

## Start and configure

Start the server and configure the game using the [in-game commands.](./commands)

:::warning
Any player in the server can run and configure AUP; consider a permissions plugin for larger servers.
